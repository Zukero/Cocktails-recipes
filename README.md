# Cocktails-recipes

[A collection of cocktail recipes](Cocktails.md), in French only for now.

This started as a simple txt file on my phone. 

(IBA) after the name means the recipe comes from the [International Bartenders Association's website](https://iba-world.com/) 

(Net) after the name means the recipe comes from some random website or blog, and I'll try to reference proper source later.

(Moi) means "Me" in French, and means it's one of my own recipes


# ToDo

* Proper source references
* Add emphasis or comment on virgin/non-alcoholic versions
* English translation, including unit conversion from metric to imperial 
* Add pictures of the result
* Add recipes for home-made ingredients
* Add/improve serving glass and garnish recommandations 
* Split recipes file, one per drink
